Fire Alarm System with Water Sprinkler project

- Designed and implemented a fire detection and extinguishing system that automatically activates water
sprinklers upon detecting fire utilizing Arduino IDE for programming and debugging.
- Programmed the Arduino UNO to process flame sensor data and activate water sprinklers and alarms
when fire is detected.
- Integrated hardware components, including sensors, relays, and a water pump, for seamless operation.
- Designed the circuit layout and ensured proper wiring for efficient and safe functionality.
- Conducted multiple test scenarios to ensure reliable fire detection and rapid response.
